# Hearts Scoring

A simple app to test my skills in Python and Flask.

Hearts is a trick-taking card game played with a deck of 52 cards.
It is three or four players and the goal of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of the game.

This Flask app helps players keep track of their scores.
